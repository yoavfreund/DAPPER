"""Paralellisation via multiprocessing. Limit num. of CPUs used by `numpy` to 1."""

# To facilitate debugging, import mp here (where it's used).
# For example, `matplotlib` (its event loop) might clash (however mysteriously)
# with mp, so it's nice to be able to be sure that no mp is "in the mix".
import multiprocessing_on_dill as mpd
# Enforcing individual core usage.
# Issue: numpy uses multiple cores (github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11826).
#     This may yield some performance gain, but typically not much
#     compared to "manual" parallelization over
#     experiments, ensemble members, or local analyses.
#     Therefore: force numpy to only use a single core.

# ... N  = 4*10**3
# ... a  = np.random.randn(N, N)

def Pool(NPROC=None):
    """Initialize a multiprocessing `Pool`.

    - Uses `pathos/dill` for serialisation.
    - Provides unified interface for multiprocessing on/off (as a function of NPROC).

    There is some overhead associated with the pool creation,
    so you likely want to re-use a pool rather than repeatedly creating one.
    Consider using `functools.partial` to fix kwargs.

    .. note::
        In contrast to *reading*, in-place writing does not work with multiprocessing.
        This changes with "shared" arrays, but that has not been tested here.
        By contrast, multi*threading* shares the process memory,
        but was significantly slower in the tested (pertinent) cases.

    .. caution::
        `multiprocessing` does not mix with `matplotlib`, so ensure `func` does not
        reference `xp.stats.LP_instance`. In fact, `func` should not reference `xp`
        at all, because it takes time to serialize.

    See example use in `dapper.mods.QG` and `dapper.da_methods.LETKF`.
